    <p class="intro"> Anita Tan
      <br> Seattle, WA </br>
      <br> HiÔºÅI am Anita, and I am a 3rd year Informatics student at the University of Washington. I am extremely passionate about using technology to <b> solve problems </b> and make a <b> positive impact </b> on the world. </br>
    
    <br> In particular, I am interested in using technology to <strong> improve education equity for underpriviledge and underrepresented students </strong>. </br>
    
    <br> I am a coding instructor at Coding with Kids, where I design and deliver 
    engaging lessons in Scratch. I tailor my instruction to meet the needs of 
    learners at different skill levels, ensuring that each student can grasp key 
    programming concepts at their own pace. My goal is to foster creativity, 
    problem-solving skills, and confidence in young coders by creating a supportive 
    and encouraging classroom environment. Through this role, I strive to make 
    technology education accessible and inspiring for the next generation of 
    innovators.
